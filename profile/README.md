Deep Search extracts and structures data from documents in four steps: Parse, Interpret, Index, and Integrate. Try out the first steps on our public system, where we have a live PDF->JSON inspector. With the inspector, you can see how your (programmatic) PDF documents get converted into JSON.

Deep Search also provides a programmatic access to the service, for easy integration with other tools or in order to do bulk conversion. Our python toolkit provides these functionalities both as a client and library.
